    <h2> Phantom of the Opera Quote Book <span style="color: #BF5D57">Print Media </span> </h2>
    <h6 class=""></h6>
    <p class="title-description">The Phantom of the Opera is a book,play and movie which is dark, romantic, passion and dramatic. It takes place in the Belle Epoque era which is at the same time as the Victorian and Edwardian Era.

For this quote book, I created a wax sealed envelope. According to the book/play and movie, the Opera Ghost used to send notes or letters to the stage managers. I wanted to incorporate this idea with the quote book.

Typefaces
The typefaces were carefully chosen for this proyect. After lots of research about what kind of typefaces they use in this time, I finally picked two different typefaces called: ITC Century Std  and ITC Century Std. Every character has its own font to create mood and feeling. The Phantom has a dark, scary but readable font while the Vicomte Raoul has a classy one, unlike Christine, hers is handwritten for a more human feeling.
For the background , I wanted t look as if the letters were from long time ago. For that,  I soak a piece of paper in tea to make wrinkles and give that old look, took a picture to it and opened it in photoshop and gave it a golden colour..</p>

        <h2> Pub Italia Re-branding <span style="color: #BF5D57">Print Media </span> </h2>
        <h6 class=""></h6>
        <p class="title-description"> The desired perception of Pub Italia is to create an atmosphere that was cosy and warm – characteristics the owner points out that this is fundamental to both Irish pubs and Italian trattorias. Also is to go back in time when the monasteries fostered the art of beer and wine making, trattorias and pubs became the places of choice in which to consume them.</p>
