      <h2 class="title-project">Admintotal</h2>
      <h6 class="">Branding </h6>
      <p class="title-description"> Admintotal is a mexican company that sells an administration software that allows you to manage your company from any mobile device. They wanted a unique brand where people can stand out from their competitors. They wanted a brand that looks welcoming, professional, different and a logo that can be easily recognize. For their logo I created a shape of a triangle that every corner represents the conection between 3 devices which are: smartphones, tablets and desktops. Also the icon looks
        like a cursor which represents the 'web' part of it. Without metioning that the icon has the letter 'A' shape which symbolizes Admintotal's first letter. To finalize the design of the logo icon, it also represents an arrow pointing up which indicates that if a company adopts admintotal, the company will improve and progress.
      <br></br>
        <br>The logo is a modern and abstract shape, it attracts attention and is also easy to recognize, the logo looks friendly and easy as the software they are offering. Which is a good thing as it does not intimidate people who do not use technology as much and invites them to use the product.</br>
